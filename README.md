# K-Means Clustering algorithm
## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm. K-means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data into groups. It aims to partition the data points into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
